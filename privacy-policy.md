# Roomstorm Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is a part of [Roomstorm Terms of Service](terms-of-service.md).

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data

We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Company collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Roomstorm and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

### Other Information

When you interact with Roomstorm through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Roomstorm may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Roomstorm affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a *help* section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.

In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Roomstorm often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Roomstorm may share this aggregate data to its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Roomstorm may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

Our Service may collect and use your location information to provide certain functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location features, your location information may be publicly displayed within the Service. Please keep in mind that other users can see this information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our control and without your knowledge. We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described above.

### Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information

Roomstorm uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Roomstorm and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the *Related Companies*) may also use Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Roomstorm and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

If Roomstorm intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

### Guest Data

We collect personal data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when an Individual seeks alternative accommodation or a Business User seeks to find accommodation for a Distressed Guest with or to a hotel who will receive such Individual or Distressed Guest (the *Winning Hotel*) through the Service. In order to find accommodation for Individuals or Distressed Guests through the Services, we may provide Personal Data of such Individuals or Distressed Guests to the Winning Hotel. However, please remember that the manner in which the Winning Hotel uses, stores and discloses Individual or Distressed Guest information is governed by the policies of such Winning Hotel, and Roomstorm shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of the Winning Hotel. The Services may also use the Personal Data of a Distressed Guest to send such Distressed Guest information about their accommodation, at the request of the Business User.

### Google Analytics

We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (*Google*). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, please refer to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

### Data Disclosure
