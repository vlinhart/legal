## 1. Acceptance of Terms

Roomstorm, Inc. DBA Roomstorm (*Roomstorm*) provides its *Service* (as defined below) to you through its website located at roomstorm.com (the "Site"), subject to this Terms of Service agreement (*TOS*). In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, the [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md). All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into this TOS. By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service or Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS. If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company, business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this TOS, in which case the terms *you* or *your* shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you must not accept this TOS and may not use the Service.

Roomstorm may change this TOS from time to time. If we do this, we will post the changes to this TOS on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Service user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new TOS.

## 2. Description of Service

Roomstorm enables authorized individuals seeking hotel accommodations (an *Individual*) and businesses such as hotels, airlines, and other businesses in need of arranging hotel accommodations for a customer (such business, a *Business User,* and such customer, a *Distressed Guest*) to easily find or be matched with hotels (the *Winning Hotel*) that can accommodate the Distressed Guest, all through a single platform. The Service includes:

  1. The roomstorm.com website
  2. Platform for Business Users (B2B App)
  3. Platform for Individuals (B2C App)
  4. Communication services (email, text and voice)
  5. Any software, data, reports, texts, images, video and audio content made available through the foregoing (collectively referred to as the *Content*)

Any new features added to or augmenting the Service are also subject to this TOS.

Roomstorm does not itself provide hotel accommodations, and Roomstorm is not a hotel. Roomstorm offers information and a method to connect Individuals and Business Users with hotels, but does not and does not intend to provide hotel accommodations, and has no responsibility or liability for any hotel accommodation or reservation obtained by any hotel or provided by any hotel using the services. Roomstorm does not guarantee the availability of any booking made through the site or services.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS, you may access and use the Service only for lawful purposes. All rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components will remain with and belong exclusively to Roomstorm. You shall not display, distribute, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, time share or otherwise make the Service available to any third party or, except as expressly permitted herein, use the Service on behalf of a third party. You shall comply with any codes of conduct, policies or other notices Roomstorm provides you or publishes in connection with the Service, and you shall promptly notify Roomstorm if you learn of a security breach related to the Service.

The failure of Roomstorm to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this TOS shall not be a waiver of that right. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and Roomstorm, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Roomstorm, and it governs your use of the Service and takes the place of any prior agreements between you and Roomstorm. If any provision of this TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this TOS remain in full force and effect.

Except if you are an Individual, Roomstorm reserves the right to use your name and/or company name as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on Roomstorm’s website and in other communications with existing or potential Roomstorm customers.

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service, including the Site and Content, and all server and network components are provided on an *as is* and *as available* basis without any warranties of any kind, and Roomstorm expressly disclaims any and all warranties, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You acknowledge that Roomstorm does not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, error-free or virus-free, nor does it make any warranty as to the results that may by obtained from use of the services, including without limitation the quality or nature of any accommodations or that any booking will result in accommodations for an Individual or Distressed Guest, and no information, advice or services obtained by you from Roomstorm or through the service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in this TOS.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall Roomstorm be liable to you or any third party for (a) any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages, including lost profits, lost sales or business, lost data or business interruption, (b) for any direct damages, costs, losses or liabilities in excess of the fees actually paid by you in the six months preceding the event giving rise to your claim or, if no fees apply, one hundred US dollars; or (c) any matter beyond its reasonable control (including without limitation, the failure of any booking to result in accommodations, or the quality, nature or cancellation of any accommodations made as a result of any booking). The provisions of this section allocate the risks under this TOS between the parties, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into this TOS.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In these states, Roomstorm’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## 12. Indemnification and Release

You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Roomstorm from and against any claims, actions or demands, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of this TOS, any of Your Content, or your other access, contribution to, use or misuse of the Service. Roomstorm shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit or demand. Roomstorm reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Roomstorm’s defense of such matter. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: *A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.* If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

## 13. Arbitration

At Roomstorm’s or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this TOS or the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in this TOS. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in this TOS and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under this TOS, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

## 14. Assignment

You may not assign this TOS without the prior written consent of Roomstorm, but Roomstorm may assign or transfer this TOS, in whole or in part, without restriction.

## 15. Governing Law

This TOS shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. Unless otherwise elected by Roomstorm in a particular instance, you hereby expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located within San Francisco, California for the purpose of resolving any dispute relating to your access to or use of the Service not subject to arbitration, as set forth above. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or this TOS must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

## 16. DMCA

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the *DMCA*) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Roomstorm will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the DMCA and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Roomstorm’s Copyright Agent at support@roomstorm.com in writing and contain the following information:

  - subject line: *DMCA* Takedown Request*
  - an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest
  - a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed
  - a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, with enough detail that we may find it on the Site
  - your address, telephone number, and email address
  - a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law
  - a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner‘s behalf.

### Counter-Notice

If you believe that the relevant Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

  - your physical or electronic signature
  - identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled
  - a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content
  - your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal courts located within the Northern District of California and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Roomstorm will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Roomstorm’s sole discretion.

### Repeat Infringer Policy

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Roomstorm has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Roomstorm's sole discretion, members who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Roomstorm may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Site and/or terminate the memberships of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
